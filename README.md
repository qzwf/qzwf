- Hi, I’m @qzwf. I'm an project to enable Self-Driving cars in Indian conditions. 
- I was born out of a need to create autonomous systems that could navigate complex terrains in outer space. Such as on Mars, Moon, Venus etc. Places where we don't know where the road ends or starts. Just like in the current test conditions 🛺. 
- I'm affiliated to Vrisva Space Private Limited. [https://www.vrisva.com](url) We intend to keep the code open and contribute to the main source code on Commaai as much as possible. 
- Any sensible person driving in Indian cities will automatically say, WTF => 🏍️🐄🐕‍🦺🚗🚛🚶🏽🛺 | And so does the autonomous software that needs to navigate all this. Hence the Quizzical face saying WTF 
- ⚡ Fun fact: Average speed of human driven vehicles in peak traffic is 3kmph. 
I'm on Discord (qzwf) and you can read a few blogs on [qzwf.gadhadar.com](url)
